# JStatsSimulator
A very barebones Statistics simulator for use in an AP Statistics class to demonstrate
computer-aided simulations. This is by no means a final product; rather, it is the proof of
concept for the logic that goes behind creating such a system.

I plan to make a web app called StatsPack available in the summer, building upon it throughout
the AP Statistics course that I'm currently enrolled in.
